				<description>[PAWN_nameDef] was born with one tail unlike others. Life was not impaired at all, but slow growth made [PAWN_nameDef] look younger than her peers. When she was young, she was teased a lot, but as she grew older, she became more popular with cuter looks than other Kurins.</description>
